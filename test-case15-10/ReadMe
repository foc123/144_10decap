This is a simple example to illustrate chiplet+interposer system's PDN
model generation and simulation.


To generate chiplet PDN netlist:  # change chiplet1 netlist
$bin/diegen chiplet1.conf


[NOTE] For now, the intentional decap density is set to 0 in the config file,
so all the  intentional decap values are 0 (effectively no decap) in the
generated netlist. This is used as the basis for decap optimization. Note in
real case, there will be non-zero decaps.


To generate interposer PDN netlist:
$bin/intgen int1.conf

To create randomly placed decaps:
$bin/diedcapgen 10 1e-9 chiplet1_vdd.decap vdd_decap.1

[NOTE] Ten decaps whose values are 1nF are generated in file "vdd_decap.1".
Note you need to manually include this file in the chiplet's subckt
"chiplet1_tr.subckt". Later, this step can be performed by a python script.

To run spice for transient simulation:
$ngspice -b interposer1_tr.sp -r interposer1_tr.raw

To extract VDI from transient simulation result:
$bin/inttrvmap int1.conf interposer1_tr.raw 1.0 0.05

To get chiplet VDI info:
$python3 utils/prvdi.py chiplet1_vdd_1_vdi.csv

To plot chiplet VDI map:
$python utils/pltvdroopint.py chiplet1_vdd_1_vdi.csv
